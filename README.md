# deep-learning-for-classification

to train the model use python3 train.py

training data consists of images with different classes on which the model been trained.
folder models consists of model which is genrated by running train.py 
and fruits-fcl-hdf5 is genrated by running final-hope jupyter file which use VGG16 architecture and imagenet as a pretrained data

to test the model which is already trained use python3 predict.py 'path/filename.jpg'
